# Installation

If you want to install the computational environment on your own computer, you need to install first the Anaconda software, see <https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual>. Once you have Anaconda installed (as it is in the computer lab), do the following: 

* Download the [environment file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uh-comp-methods1/intro/main/docs/environment.yml)
* Open Anaconda Navigator
* Click Environments
* Click Import
* Choose the file `environment.yml` that you downloaded and click Import

The last step takes a while so wait patiently. Once the environment is istalled, start JupyterLab in Anaconda Navigator:

* Click Home
* Select **comp-methods** in the Applications dropdown menu
* Click the Launch button of JupyterLab

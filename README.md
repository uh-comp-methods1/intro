# Introduction

The Jupyter notebook `python_intro.ipynb` gives an interactive introduction Python. The interactive examples can be run either in a cloud environment or on your computer. The former option requires no installation but can be slow to start up and has limited computational resources. The latter option requires some setting up but is more convenient in the long run.
